# MOONGATE

I am constructing a large circular moon gate as part of some bookshelves for my room.
To form the support system for this moon gate, I intend to use a laser-cutter to cut out
pieces which can be assembled into an annulur prism.

This code is intended to allow my to design these pieces and be able to adapt later to
the thickness of the materials and the kerf of the laser cutter.
